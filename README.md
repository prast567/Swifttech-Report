# Swifttech-Report

In this project, I have applied the my cybersecurity analyst skills to analyze data provided about a fictional technology company and create fundamental components of the company’s GRC program.

In particular, I have identified potentially relevant compliance obligations, modified a risk management policy to meet the company’s specific needs, assessed risks apparent in the company’s infrastructure leveraging common risk management frameworks, and developed governance activities to ensure security controls are operating as expected.
